# Algorithms

- Problem Set 1: Percolation (Estimate the value of the percolation threshold via Monte Carlo simulation)
- Problem Set 2: Deques and Randomized Queues (Generic deque and a randomized queue)
- Problem Set 3: Collinear Points (Recognize line patterns in a given set of points)
- Problem Set 4: 8-Puzzle (Solve the 8-puzzle problem using A*)
- Problem Set 5: Kd-Tree (Represent a set of points in the unit square using a 2d-tree)
